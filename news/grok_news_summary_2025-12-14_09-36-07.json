    "summary": "### AI and Technology Developments Summary\nAs of 2025-12-14T09:36 UTC, the past 24 hours (from 2025-12-13) have seen limited major releases directly within this window, based on available web searches, news sources, and social media discussions. Activity includes mentions of new models and papers, with some announcements echoing recent trends. Where data is sparse, I've included notable developments from the past week, clearly noting their dates for context. Information is drawn from sources like TechCrunch, arXiv, Hugging Face, and posts on X (formerly Twitter), cross-verified for relevance. Focus is on verifiable details; unconfirmed social media claims are noted as such.\n\n#### Model Releases and Updates\n- **DeepCogito v2**: An open-source AI model released with enhancements in logical reasoning and task planning, reportedly outperforming some closed models. Discussed on X as a breakthrough for industry applications like improved decision-making in AI agents. (Date: Mentioned on 2025-12-13; potential impact on open-source accessibility. Link: No direct URL provided; search Hugging Face for \"DeepCogito v2\").\n- **24B FP8 Agentic Coding Model**: A trending model on Hugging Face, focused on multi-file editing, codebase exploration, and strong performance on benchmarks like SWE-bench. Highlighted for its efficiency in coding tasks. (Date: Trending as of 2025-12-13. Link: [Hugging Face model page](https://huggingface.co/models?search=24B%20FP8)).\n- **GPT-5.2 from OpenAI**: Announced as now available via ChatGPT, building on prior versions with unspecified updates (likely refinements in reasoning or efficiency). This follows OpenAI's pattern of iterative releases. (Date: Announced on 2025-12-13 per X posts; see TechCrunch for context on ChatGPT updates. Link: [TechCrunch article](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/12/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot)).\n- **Google Deep Research Tool** (Recent context): Launched based on Gemini 3 Pro, embeddable in apps for advanced research tasks. While the announcement was on 2025-12-11 (just outside 24 hours), it's seeing ongoing discussion. (Link: [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/google-launched-its-deepest-ai-research-agent-yet-on-the-same-day-openai-dropped-gpt-5-2/)).\n\nNo other major proprietary releases (e.g., from Meta or Anthropic) were found in the exact 24-hour window; check official blogs for updates.\n\n#### New Research Papers\nThe past 24 hours include one notable paper upload, with others mentioned in discussions from 2025-12-13. If sparse, I've added recent papers from the past week, noting dates. Focus is on AI-related categories like machine learning and infrastructure.\n\n| Title | Authors | Abstract Summary | Submission Date | Link |\n|-------|---------|------------------|-----------------|------|\n| Digital Twin and AI Models for Infrastructure Resilience: A Systematic Knowledge Mapping | Not specified in excerpt (from MDPI) | A bibliometric analysis of how Digital Twins (DT) and AI enhance infrastructure resilience, identifying research clusters and trends using Web of Science data.

Gaining traction on X for its potential in agent-based systems. (Date: 2025-12-13. Link: Likely on GitHub or Hugging Face; search for \"DeepCogito v2 repo\").\n- **Trending Hugging Face Models/Tools**: Includes the 24B FP8 model for coding, with integrations for multi-file tasks. Also, mentions of new spaces or datasets on Hugging Face. (Date: 2025-12-13. Link: [Hugging Face trending](https://huggingface.co/models)).\n- **Nvidia Open AI Models for Autonomous Driving** (Recent context): New tools and models released for physical AI and autonomous research, including reasoning world models. Announced 2 weeks ago but discussed recently. (Link: [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/nvidia-announces-new-open-ai-models-and-tools-for-autonomous-driving-research/)).\n\nLimited new GitHub repos with >50 stars in the exact window; trending Python repos on GitHub show ongoing AI tool development, but expand searches to the past week for more (e.g., via [GitHub trending](https://github.com/trending/python?since=daily)).\n\n#### General AI News\nIn the past 24 hours, general AI news has been light, with coverage on broader trends like the ongoing AI boom and infrastructure applications (e.g., Guardian's AI updates on 2025-12-13 and NYT spotlight on 2025-12-13, discussing AI's role in education and internal tech firm dynamics). Tech layoffs continued as a theme, with a comprehensive 2025 list updated on 2025-12-13 via TechCrunch, highlighting job cuts in AI-adjacent sectors amid economic shifts. TIME Magazine's \"Architects of AI\" as Person of the Year (announced 2025-12-11) is still generating buzz, featuring figures like Jensen Huang and Sam Altman. Regulatory discussions persist, with federal vs. state AI rules debated (from 2 weeks ago but relevant). On X, sentiment around breakthroughs like GPT-5.2 and open-source models shows excitement, though unverified. For big tech, no major new announcements from firms like Google or OpenAI in the exact window beyond the model mentions above; check sources like [Reuters Tech](https://www.reuters.com/technology/) or company blogs for real-time confirmations. If data remains sparse, this may reflect weekend lulls in announcements.",
