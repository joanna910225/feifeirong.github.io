This summary focuses on significant developments from 2025-11-23 to now, based on web searches, news sources, and social media discussions (e.g., posts on X). Data within the exact 24-hour window is somewhat sparse, so I've included notable items from the past week where relevant, clearly noting dates for transparency. Prioritized verifiable sources like arXiv, Hugging Face, and official announcements; cross-verified social buzz with web info.\n\n#### Model Releases and Updates\n- **GPT-5 Series (OpenAI)**: Discussions on X highlight OpenAI's GPT-5 model, noted for speeding up research in math and science. A monthly digest published on 2025-11-23 also mentions GPT-5.1 as part of major November launches. Key features include enhanced reasoning capabilities. (Source: Posts on X; [humai.blog digest](https://www.humai.blog/ai-news-november-2025-monthly-digest/); note: Exact release within past 24 hours unconfirmed, but buzz peaked on 2025-11-23).\n- **Gemini 3 and SAM 3**: Included in the November 2025 AI roundup (published 2025-11-23), these are new model launches from Google and Meta, respectively, focusing on multimodal AI advancements. Impacts include improved image/video generation and accessibility. (Source: [humai.blog](https://www.humai.blog/ai-news-november-2025-monthly-digest/); from earlier in November, but summarized recently).\n- **Kandinsky 5.0**: A family of foundation models for image and video generation, highlighted in top AI papers on Hugging Face for the week of November 17-23. Released or discussed on 2025-11-23. (Source: Posts on X; likely available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co)).\n\nIf no major releases in the exact 24-hour window, check official blogs like [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog) or [Google AI](https://blog.google/technology/ai/) for updates.\n\n#### New Research Papers\nBased on arXiv and bioRxiv scans via web searches, here are notable papers uploaded or discussed in the past 24 hours (2025-11-23 onward). If sparse, included recent ones from the past week with dates noted. Presented in table format for clarity.\n\n| Title | Authors | Abstract Summary | Upload Date | Link | Impact Notes |\n|-------|---------|------------------|-------------|------|--------------|\n| Kandinsky 5.0: A Family of Foundation Models for Image and Video Generation | Various (Hugging Face community) | Introduces scalable models for high-quality image/video synthesis, pushing boundaries in generative AI. | Week of 2025-11-17 (discussed 2025-11-23) | [arXiv or Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/papers) | High potential for creative tools; gained traction on X. |\n| MiroThinker: Pushing the Performance Boundaries of Open-Source Research Agents via Model, Context, and Interactive Scaling | Various | Explores scaling techniques for AI agents in research tasks, improving efficiency. | Week of 2025-11-17 (discussed 2025-11-23) | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) | Advances open-source agent tech; part of weekly Hugging Face highlights. |\n| Agent0: Can LLM Agents Evolve from Scratch with Zero Human Data? | Huaxiu Yao et al. | Proposes a framework for self-evolving LLM agents using tools and co-evolution, breaking knowledge limits. | 2025-11-23 | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) (based on X post) | Innovative for autonomous AI; discussed widely on X with 35+ favorites. |\n| Untitled Protein Design Model (bioRxiv) | Jain, S., Beazer, J., Ruffolo, J.
