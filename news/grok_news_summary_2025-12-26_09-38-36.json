Where data is sparse, I've included notable items from the past week, clearly noting their dates for context. Summaries are based on recent web sources and social media discussions on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), cross-verified for relevance. Focus is on verifiable or high-impact items; unverified claims (e.g., from social posts) are noted as such.\n\n#### Model Releases and Updates\n- **OpenAI's GPT-5.2-Codex-Xmas**: Social media posts on X indicate OpenAI released a holiday-themed coding model called \"gpt-5.2-codex-xmas\" on December 25, 2025. It's described as a specialized variant for coding tasks with a festive twist, though this appears unverified and may be satirical or promotional—official confirmation from OpenAI's site is lacking. If accurate, it builds on recent GPT-5.2 advancements in reasoning. (Source: X discussions; check https://openai.com/blog for updates).\n- **DeepSeek V3.2 Models** (from past week, released ~December 1, 2025): Chinese AI firm DeepSeek unveiled open-source models rivaling GPT-5 and Gemini 3.0 Pro in performance, with features like sparse attention and reasoning-with-tools. Available for free, emphasizing cost-efficiency. Impact: Democratizes high-end AI access. Link: https://venturebeat.com/ai/deepseek-just-dropped-two-insanely-powerful-ai-models-that-rival-gpt-5-and (Note: Not within 24 hours, but a significant recent release).\n- **Nvidia Nemotron 3 Family** (from past week, announced December 15, 2025): Nvidia launched new open-source AI models as part of bulking up its offerings, alongside acquiring SchedMD. These focus on scalable AI training. Impact: Enhances open-source ecosystem for enterprise use. Link: https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/nvidia-bulks-up-open-source-offerings-with-an-acquisition-and-new-open-ai-models (Note: From past week).\n\nNo other major model releases were found in the exact 24-hour window; activity may pick up post-holidays.\n\n#### New Research Papers\nRecent arXiv uploads and preprints are limited in the past 24 hours, with some discussions pointing to December 24-25 activity. Below is a table of notable AI-related papers from the period (or recent if sparse), focusing on cs.AI, cs.LG, and related categories. I've included a few from December 24-25 based on web sources and social mentions; for fuller lists, check arXiv.org.\n\n| Title | Authors | Abstract Summary | Submission Date | Link |\n|-------|---------|------------------|-----------------|------|\n| VL-JEPA: Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture for Vision-Language Tasks | Yann LeCun et al. | Explores a joint embedding model for vision-language integration, building on JEPA architectures for better multimodal understanding. | December 2025 (latest noted in social discussions) | https://arxiv.org (search for \"VL-JEPA\") |\n| Various AI Papers from Hugging Face Digest | Multiple (e.g., from daily digest) | Covers recent uploads on topics like generative models and AI-native systems; specific titles not detailed in sources, but includes advancements in AI reasoning. | December 24, 2025 | https://huggingface.co/papers (daily digest) |\n| AI-Driven Antibody Design Breakthrough | Chai Discovery Team | Introduces methods for AI-optimized antibody generation, potentially accelerating biotech applications. (Noted as a preprint or announcement.) | December 25, 2025 | https://x.com/posi2ive/status/2004288463521321331 (social mention; verify on bioRxiv.org) |\n\nIf no new uploads appear on arXiv for December 25-26, this may reflect holiday slowdowns—expand to past week for more (e.g., papers on world models or sparse attention from early December).\n\n#### Open-Source Projects and Tools\nOpen-source activity in the past 24 hours is minimal, with no high-star GitHub repos or Hugging Face spaces emerging prominently. Trending items from the past week include:\n- **Nvidia's Open AI Models and Tools for Autonomous Driving** (announced ~December 1, 2025): New open-source reasoning world models and tools for physical AI, including simulations for self-driving research. Impact: Advances real-world AI applications like robotics. Link: https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/nvidia-announces-new-open-ai-models-and-tools-for-autonomous-driving-research (Note: From past week; check GitHub for repos).\n- **Slurm-Related Tools via Nvidia Acquisition** (December 15, 2025): Following Nvidia's acquisition of SchedMD, updates to Slurm (open-source workload manager) for AI training clusters. Impact: Improves scalability for large-scale AI projects. Link: https://github.com/SchedMD/slurm (Note: Recent integration).\n\nFor trending repos, GitHub's daily Python trends show AI-focused tools with >50 stars, but none newly created in the 24-hour window—suggest checking https://github.com/trending/python.\n\n#### General AI News\nIn the past 24 hours, AI news has been subdued, with discussions on web sources like ScienceDaily and The New York Times highlighting ongoing trends in generative AI and ethical concerns (e.g., humanlike chatbots and AI in home design, published December 25, 2025). A notable breakthrough article from CNET (December 25) discusses the rise of \"world models\" in AI, which simulate real-world dynamics beyond traditional LLMs, positioning them as a next step for more intuitive systems—impact could include better predictions in fields like robotics (link: https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/step-aside-llms-ai-world-models-are-here/). On the business side, Nvidia's major deal to acquire assets from AI chip startup Groq for ~$20 billion was reported on December 24-25, marking its largest ever; this includes licensing technology and hiring executives, potentially accelerating AI hardware innovation (sources: CNBC and Reuters, e.g., https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/24/nvidia-buying-ai-chip-startup-groq-for-about-20-billion-biggest-deal.html). Social sentiment on X reflects holiday wraps of 2025 AI milestones, like OpenAI's GPT-5 series and Sora, but no new firm actions from big tech (e.g., Google, Microsoft) in the exact window. Quantum computing news from sites like Quantum Computing Report notes minor updates from December 25, but nothing groundbreaking. Overall, expect more activity as the week progresses; for real-time checks, visit sites like TechCrunch or VentureBeat.",
