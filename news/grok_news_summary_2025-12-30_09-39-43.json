Venture capitalists predict stronger enterprise AI adoption in 2026, focusing on agents and budgets, building on trends from firms like OpenAI and Google. Breakthroughs include advancements in open-source reasoning models and prompt optimization methods, while Meta's language expansion aims at inclusivity. Earlier in the week (2025-12-11), Google launched its Deep Research tool based on Gemini 3 Pro, coinciding with OpenAI's GPT-5.2 release, intensifying rivalry in research agents. No major regulatory actions or investments were reported in the window, but sentiment on X suggests growing interest in agentic AI and video generation tools challenging big tech dominance. For the latest, monitor official blogs from OpenAI, Meta, and Nvidia.
